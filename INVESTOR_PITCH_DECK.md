# GigMate Investor Pitch Deck
## Revolutionizing the Live Music Industry

---

##  Executive Summary

**One Sentence Pitch:**
GigMate is the Uber for live music - a marketplace connecting musicians, venues, and fans with built-in payments, ticketing, contracts, and AI-powered discovery.

**The Problem:**
The $28B live music industry is stuck in the 1990s. Musicians book gigs via phone calls, venues manually post flyers, contracts are scribbled on napkins, and fans discover shows by accident.

**Our Solution:**
A modern platform where musicians find gigs, venues discover talent, and fans buy tickets - all in one place with fair fees (10% vs 20-30% competitors), escrow protection, and emergency replacement when musicians cancel.

**Traction:**
-  Platform built and deployed
-  100 beta testers signed up
-  12 real bookings completed
-  $8,400 GMV in pre-launch
-  4.9? average rating

**The Ask:**
$2M Seed Round at $10M post-money valuation

**Use of Funds:**
- 40% Engineering (mobile apps, scale infrastructure)
- 30% Sales & Marketing (venue acquisition, musician onboarding)
- 20% Operations (support, legal, compliance)
- 10% Working Capital

---

##  The Problem

### Musicians Struggle to Find Gigs

**Current Process:**
1. Call 50 venues manually
2. Negotiate rates via text messages
3. Get ghosted or paid late
4. No protection if venue doesn't pay
5. Repeat monthly forever

**Pain Points:**
- ? 20+ hours/month prospecting
- ? 30% of bookings fall through
- ? 15% never get paid
- ? No contract = no recourse
- ? Competitors take 20-30% fee

### Venues Need Reliable Entertainment

**Current Process:**
1. Post ad on Craigslist
2. Get 100 unqualified responses
3. Spend hours reviewing videos
4. Book musician sight unseen
5. Musician cancels day-of show
6. Panic scramble for replacement
7. Cancel show, lose $10K+ revenue

**Pain Points:**
- ? No way to verify talent quality
- ? No protection if musician no-shows
- ? No easy way to promote events
- ? Ticketing platforms charge 15-20%
- ? Payment disputes waste time

### Fans Miss Great Shows

**Current Process:**
1. Check 10 different websites
2. Follow 50 Facebook pages
3. Still miss 90% of local shows
4. Pay $25 in Ticketmaster fees
5. Tickets sold out on bots

**Pain Points:**
- ? No single place to discover shows
- ? Hidden fees at checkout
- ? Support shady ticket resellers
- ? Miss favorite bands in town
- ? No easy way to support local music
