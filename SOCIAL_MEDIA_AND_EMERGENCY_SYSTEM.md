### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema

**social_media_accounts:**
```sql
- user_id (links to profile)
- platform (facebook, instagram, etc.)
- username
- profile_url
- access_token (encrypted)
- is_connected (boolean)
- can_post (boolean)
- last_synced_at
```

**social_media_posts:**
```sql
- user_id
- platforms (array)
- content (text)
- media_urls (array)
- event_id (optional link)
- post_type
- scheduled_for
- status (draft, scheduled, posted, failed)
- platform_post_ids (JSON - IDs from each platform)
- engagement_stats (JSON - likes, shares, comments)
```

#### OAuth Flow

**Connection Process:**

1. User clicks "Connect Instagram"
2. Redirected to Instagram OAuth
3. User authorizes GigMate
4. Receives access_token + refresh_token
5. Tokens stored encrypted in database
6. Connection marked as active
7. User can now post to Instagram from GigMate

**Security:**
- Tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- Refresh tokens rotated regularly
- Revocable by user at any time
- Scopes limited to posting only (can't read DMs)

#### Cross-Posting Logic

```typescript
async function postToAllPlatforms(post) {
  const results = [];

  for (const platform of post.platforms) {
    try {
      const account = await getAccount(post.user_id, platform);

      if (platform === 'instagram') {
        const result = await postToInstagram(account, post);
        results.push({ platform, success: true, post_id: result.id });
      } else if (platform === 'facebook') {
        const result = await postToFacebook(account, post);
        results.push({ platform, success: true, post_id: result.id });
      }
      // ... other platforms

    } catch (error) {
      results.push({ platform, success: false, error: error.message });
    }
  }

  // Update post with results
  await updatePost(post.id, {
    status: 'posted',
    platform_post_ids: results,
    posted_at: new Date()
  });
}
```

## Part 3: Emergency Replacement System

### The Problem It Solves

**Scenario:**

> **Friday, 6pm:** Band cancels on venue for tonight's 9pm show. Venue scrambles to find replacement. Calls 20 musicians. None available. Show cancelled. Venue loses ticket revenue, fan trust, reputation.

**GigMate Solution:**

> **Friday, 6pm:** Band cancels. GigMate automatically searches 150-mile radius for available musicians matching genres. Finds 8 candidates with emergency rates. Venue reviews, selects, books replacement in 10 minutes. Show goes on!

### Premium Feature Only

**Available To:**
- Regional tier venues ($49.99/month)
- State tier venues ($99.99/month)
- National tier venues ($199.99/month)

**Not Available To:**
- Free venues
- Local tier ($19.99/month)

**Why Premium:**
- Emergency search is expensive (computational + priority)
- Premium musicians opt-in (most are premium tier)
- High-value feature justifies upgrade
- Prevents abuse (free tiers might cancel/rebook repeatedly)

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Booking Cancellation

**Musician cancels booking:**

```typescript
await cancelBooking(bookingId, {
  reason: "Family emergency - unable to perform",
  status: 'cancelled'
});

// Automatically triggers emergency_replacement_search()
```

#### Step 2: Automatic Search

**System executes:**

```sql
-- Check if venue is premium
SELECT subscription_type FROM subscriptions
WHERE user_id = venue_id AND status = 'active';

-- If premium, create emergency replacement request
INSERT INTO emergency_replacements (
  original_booking_id,
  venue_id,
  event_date,
  original_rate,
  max_emergency_rate, -- original_rate * 1.5
  search_radius_miles, -- 100 (regional), 150 (state), 200 (national)
  required_genres, -- same as cancelled musician
  expires_at -- now() + 4 hours
);

-- Find candidates
SELECT * FROM find_emergency_replacement_musicians(
  venue_id,
  event_date,
  required_genres,
  search_radius_miles,
  max_emergency_rate
);
```

#### Step 3: Candidate Matching

**Algorithm finds musicians who:**

1.  Have emergency availability enabled
2.  Match required genres
3.  Are not booked that date
4.  Emergency rate <= max_emergency_rate
5.  Within search radius
6.  Available on short notice

**Scoring:**

```typescript
match_score = (
  genre_overlap / total_required_genres * 100
)

// Example:
// Required: [Rock, Blues, Country]
// Musician A: [Rock, Blues, Jazz] -> 66% match
// Musician B: [Rock, Blues, Country, Folk] -> 100% match
// Musician B ranked higher
```

**Sort Order:**
1. Match score (highest first)
2. Emergency rate (lowest first)
3. Average rating (highest first)
4. Total gigs (most experienced first)

#### Step 4: Venue Review

**Venue receives notification:**

```
+--------------------------------------------+
|  Emergency Replacement Needed           |
+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |
|  Original: The Blue Notes (cancelled)      |
|  Event: Friday 9pm                         |
|  Original Rate: $500                       |
|                                            |

|  Expires in: 3 hours 45 minutes            |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

#### Step 5: Booking Confirmation

**Venue selects musician:**
- Clicks "Book Now"
- Reviews emergency rate + requirements
- Confirms booking
- Musician immediately notified
- New booking created
- Original booking marked as "replaced"

**Musician receives:**
- Push notification
- SMS (optional)
- Email
- In-app message
- Must accept within response_time (usually 60 minutes)

### Emergency Availability Settings

**Musicians Configure:**

```typescript
{
  is_available: true, // Toggle on/off
  emergency_rate: 800, // $800 for emergency bookings
  max_distance_miles: 75, // Will travel up to 75 miles
  response_time_minutes: 60, // Can respond within 1 hour
  minimum_notice_hours: 4, // Need at least 4 hours notice
  requirements: [
    "PA system must be provided",
    "Load-in assistance required",
    "Green room access"
  ],
  equipment_needed: [
    "Full drum kit",
    "Bass amp",
    "Microphones (4)"
  ],
  notes: "Available for country/rock/blues gigs. Can bring full 4-piece band."
}
```

**Toggle Availability:**
- Enable when available for emergency gigs
- Disable when fully booked
- Auto-disable when booking accepted
- Re-enable manually

**Emergency Rate:**
- Set higher than normal rate (typically 1.3x - 2x)
- Compensates for short notice
- Reflects urgency premium
- Venue sees rate before booking

**Distance:**
- Maximum miles willing to travel
- Used in geofence search
- Larger radius = more opportunities
- Can adjust anytime

**Requirements:**
- List any special needs
- Equipment venue must provide
- Load-in help needed
- Technical requirements
- Venue sees before booking

### Search Radius by Tier

**Tier determines max search distance:**

| Venue Tier | Search Radius | Rationale |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Regional | 100 miles | Covers local metro + surrounding area |
| State | 150 miles | Covers multiple metros statewide |
| National | 200 miles | Major travel for major venues |

**Example (Austin, TX venue):**
- Regional (100mi): Covers San Antonio, Hill Country
- State (150mi): Adds Houston, Waco
- National (200mi): Includes Dallas/Fort Worth

### Emergency Rates

**Pricing Strategy:**

**Normal Booking:**
- Musician sets standard rate: $500
- Venue books weeks in advance
- Time to prepare, promote, etc.

**Emergency Booking:**
- Musician sets emergency rate: $750 (1.5x)
- Venue needs same-day replacement
- Short notice premium
- Urgency surcharge

**Venue's Max Rate:**
- System calculates: original_rate * 1.5
- Example: $500 booking -> max $750 emergency
- Prevents price gouging
- Fair for both parties

**Why Higher Rates:**
- Short notice inconvenience
- May cancel other plans
- Rush to venue
- Less prep time
- Deserves premium

### Success Tracking

**Metrics Tracked:**

```sql
-- For musicians
emergency_availability.total_emergency_bookings
emergency_availability.last_emergency_booking

-- For venues
emergency_replacements.status
emergency_replacements.accepted_at

-- Platform-wide
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_emergency_requests,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'accepted') as successful,
  AVG(replacement_rate - original_rate) as avg_premium,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (accepted_at - created_at))/60) as avg_response_minutes
FROM emergency_replacements;
```

**KPIs:**
- Emergency request fill rate (target: 80%+)
- Average response time (target: <30 minutes)
- Average rate premium (expect: 30-50%)
- Venue satisfaction (post-event survey)

- Lost future business: $5,000 (fans stop coming)
- Total loss: $10,000

**Scenario With GigMate:**
