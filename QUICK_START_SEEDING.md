##  Why This Matters

**Breaks the Death Spiral:**
- Most platforms: No events -> No fans -> No musicians -> Dead
- GigMate: Always has events -> Looks established -> Attracts real users

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Manual competitors: Hours to create fake activity
- GigMate: 3 minutes + auto-renewal weekly

**Network Effects:**
- New venue joins -> Sees busy calendar -> Stays
- New musician joins -> Sees gig opportunities -> Stays
- New fan joins -> Sees active community -> Stays

---

## ? Important

**Only for Development/Staging:**
- Never seed production
- Demo accounts pollute real data
- Use for testing and demos only

**Can't Run Twice:**
- Email conflicts if you try
- Reset database first if needed

**After Seeding:**
- Run `weekly_platform_refresh()` SQL
- Otherwise calendar starts empty
- Automation handles rest

---

##  Success Metrics

**You'll know it worked when:**
-  100 venues show in database
-  100 musicians show in database  
-  100-300 events on calendar
-  Events span next 4 weeks
-  All events within 20-mile radius of venue
-  Platform looks established

---

## Next Steps After Seeding

2.  Login as musician (see gig opportunities)
3.  Login as venue (see your auto-generated events)
4.  Check featured users (rotates weekly)
