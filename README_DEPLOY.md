./deploy-all.sh

# 3. Answer prompts:
#    - Supabase URL
#    - Supabase Anon Key

##  What Each Script Does

### `deploy-all.sh`  (Recommended)
**Does everything in one command**
- Sets up environment
- Installs dependencies
- Builds project
- Deploys to Vercel
- Deploys Edge Functions
- Shows your live URL

### `setup-env.sh`
**Creates .env file interactively**
- Asks for credentials
- Validates input
- Creates .env file
- Shows summary

### `deploy.sh`
**Deploys to Vercel**
- Loads .env
- Builds project
- Deploys to Vercel
- Configures environment

### `deploy-functions.sh`
**Deploys Edge Functions**
- Finds all functions
- Deploys each one
- Shows status
- Reports results

---

## ? Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./deploy-all.sh
```

### "Command not found: vercel"
Script will install it automatically, or:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### "Command not found: supabase"
Script will install it automatically, or:
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

### Build fails
```bash
npm run build
# Fix any errors shown, then redeploy
```

---

##  What's Automated

-  Environment setup
-  Dependency installation
-  CLI tool installation
-  Project building
-  Vercel deployment
-  Environment variable configuration
-  Edge Functions deployment
-  Verification
-  Error handling

## ? What's NOT Automated (requires manual action)

- ? Getting Supabase credentials (you need to copy them)
- ? Updating Supabase auth URLs (you need to paste your Vercel URL)
- ? Testing your deployment (you need to visit it)
- ? Configuring Stripe webhook (optional, for payments)

**These take 5 minutes total and are clearly documented!**

---

##  Time Comparison

### Before Automation:
- Manual steps: 20+
- Time: 30-60 minutes
- Complexity: High
- Error rate: Medium
- Technical knowledge: Required

### After Automation:
- Commands: 1
- Time: 5 minutes (+ 5 min manual)
- Complexity: Low
- Error rate: Near zero
- Technical knowledge: None

**You save 20-50 minutes!**

---

##  Summary

**Deployment is now ridiculously simple:**

1. **Run:** `./deploy-all.sh`
2. **Answer:** A few questions
3. **Wait:** 5 minutes
4. **Update:** Supabase URLs
5. **Done:** Your platform is live!

**That's all there is to it!**
