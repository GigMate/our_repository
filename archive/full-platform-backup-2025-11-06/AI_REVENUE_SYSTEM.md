## 2. AI Learning & Pattern Recognition

### User Preference Analysis

The system automatically learns:

**Genre Preferences:**
- Which music genres users view most
- Genre scoring based on interaction frequency
- Cross-genre affinity (e.g., Country + Blues)

**Price Sensitivity:**
- Preferred price ranges for tickets
- Willingness to pay patterns
- Budget vs. premium preferences

**Venue & Musician Preferences:**
- Favorite venues based on repeat visits
- Preferred musicians and similar artists
- Location preferences (distance willing to travel)

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Preferred event times (weekdays vs. weekends)
- Advance booking timeline (last-minute vs. planner)
- Social vs. solo attendance patterns

**Spending Tier Classification:**
- Budget: < $50 per transaction
- Moderate: $50-$150
- Premium: $150-$500
- Luxury: $500+

### Engagement Scoring

Each user receives an engagement score based on:
- Frequency of visits
- Depth of interaction (pages per session)
- Recency of activity
- Content consumption (videos, audio)
- Social interactions (messages, ratings)

### Purchase Likelihood Calculation

AI predicts likelihood to purchase using:
- Historical purchase frequency
- Recent engagement levels
- Cart abandonment patterns
- Search-to-purchase conversion history
- Time since last purchase

**Formula:**
```
Purchase Likelihood =
  (Purchase Rate × 0.4) +
  (Recent Activity × 0.3) +
  (Has Previous Purchase × 0.3)
```
