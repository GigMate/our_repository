## Sample Legal Language for Terms of Service Document

### Section X: Platform Transaction Requirements

**X.1 Exclusive Transaction Channel**

All transactions arising from connections made on GigMate must be processed through the GigMate payment system for twelve (12) months following initial contact between parties. This requirement applies regardless of whether subsequent communications occur on or off the platform.

**X.2 Definition of "Connection"**

A "connection" is established when:
(a) One User views another User's profile and subsequently initiates direct contact;
(b) Either party sends a message through the GigMate platform;
(c) A booking request or inquiry is submitted;
(d) Users meet through a GigMate-facilitated event or introduction.

**X.3 Covered Transactions**

Platform payment requirements apply to all monetary exchanges including but not limited to: performance fees, ticket sales, merchandise, premium messaging, tips, and any other consideration exchanged between connected parties.

**X.4 Liquidated Damages**

User acknowledges that circumvention causes damages difficult to calculate. Therefore, User agrees that GigMate may assess liquidated damages equal to the greater of: (a) platform fees that would have been collected, or (b) $500 per violation, which represents a reasonable estimate of actual damages.

**X.5 Pre-Existing Relationship Exception**

Users may declare pre-existing business relationships by providing documentation of transactions dated prior to either party's GigMate registration. Such relationships are exempt from Section X.1 upon verification.

**X.6 Survival**

This Section X survives termination of the User's account and remains enforceable for the duration of any exclusivity period then in effect.

## Why This Is Legally Defensible

**1. Common Industry Practice**
- Airbnb, VRBO, Upwork, Fiverr, TaskRabbit all have similar terms
- Courts generally uphold marketplace anti-circumvention clauses
- Protects legitimate business model

**2. Reasonable Restrictions**
- 12-month period is limited, not perpetual
- Users can eventually go direct
- Pre-existing relationships exempted
- Emergency exceptions provided

**3. Quid Pro Quo Value**
- Platform provides real services: escrow, insurance, ratings, marketing
- Fees are for services, not just introduction
- Users receive substantial benefit for fees paid

**4. Clear Notice**
- Terms presented before signup
- Reminders during use
- Users cannot claim ignorance

**5. Graduated Penalties**
- Warning before ban
- Proportional to violation severity
- Liquidated damages are reasonable estimate, not penalty

---

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediately:**
1. Have attorney review and customize for your state
2. Add these terms to signup flow with checkbox
3. Display reminders in booking confirmation emails
4. Add "Report Circumvention" feature

**Soon:**
5. Create detection algorithms for suspicious patterns
6. Set up compliance monitoring dashboard
7. Draft warning/suspension email templates
8. Create appeal process workflow

**Ongoing:**
9. Track circumvention reports monthly
10. Update terms annually based on legal developments
11. Communicate enforcement actions to deter others
12. Balance enforcement with user satisfaction

---

## Final Note

**The goal is DETERRENCE, not punishment.**

Most users will comply when:
- Terms are clear
- Platform provides value
- Fees are reasonable
- Consequences are known

Make circumvention more trouble than it's worth, and 95% of users will happily transact on-platform for the protection and convenience it provides.
