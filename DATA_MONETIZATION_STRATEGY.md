-- Gold Tier Musician

### Promoter Success Story:
*"We used GigMate's Market Entry Strategy report to choose between 3 cities for our new festival. The data clearly showed City B had the highest demand-to-supply ratio for our target genre. Year 1 ticket sales exceeded projections by 40%. The $25K report was worth every penny."*
